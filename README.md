Made with â™¥ for Sean Spicer

 In the Trump administration's first official press conference,
 White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer scolded the media for
 its alleged "attempts to lessen the enthusiasm" of Trump's 
 inaguration:
 
 "Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally 
 framed in a way, in one particular tweet, to minimize the 
 enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall. 
 This was the first time in our nation's history that 
 floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the 
 Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where 
 people were not standing, while in years past the grass 
 eliminated this visual."
 
 This Processing sketch is for Spicer, to help him spot the
 differences in crowd sizes between Trump's 2017 inauguration, 
 Obama's 2009 inauguration, and an empty National Mall. He can
 comb through the pixels of each image and discern which 
 are people, which are grass and which are bright white floor 
 covering.
